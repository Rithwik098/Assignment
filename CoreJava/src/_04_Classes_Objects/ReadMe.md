# Object Oriented Concept
Object Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides concepts like
__inheritance__, **data binding**, **polymorphism** and many more...

Object means a real world entity like __Human__, __Laptop__, __Pen__, __Ball__, etc...

### Below are few concepts which are the key factors to understand the Object Oriented World
 - Class
 - Object(An entity that has state and behaviour)
 - Inheritance
 - Polymorphism
 - Abstraction
 - Encapsulation
 
 
 #### Object
 - An entity that has state and behaviour
 - An object is an instance of a class. A class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. So, an object is the instance(result) of a class.
 Example : Dog is an Object , its has it own state(name=Duky,breed=Golden Retreiver , color=Cremish)
           and behaviour(like barking, wagging tail , eating, playing etc...)

##### What are the different ways of creating an Object
    - using new keyword
    - using getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance()
    - using clone() method
    - using deserialization
